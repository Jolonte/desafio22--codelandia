> This project was done using the following *technologies*:

 1. Vite.js
 2. SCSS
 3. Typescript

- The reason I chose Vite is because it is an all-in-one tool for you to start working with without wasting much time. It also generates more optimized pages.

- I chose to work with SCSS because Vite offers direct support for it. It also has better syntax or "super powers" that normal CSS does not have.

- TypeScript offers support at development time.

> Here is a step-by-step how to create a similar project:

 1. First, it is recommended that you use Vite.js. To install it:
 
    yarn create vite *project_name* --template vanilla.ts
    cd *project_name*
    yarn
    
 2. To install SCSS:
 
    yarn add sass
   
 Feel free to study the code and understand how I did each thing.

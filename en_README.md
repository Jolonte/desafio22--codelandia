Welcome to my project repository "Dev Community"! Here, I explored integration with the Github API, using TypeScript with an object-oriented approach to generate cards with information from user repositories searched in the search field.

## Overview

This project is part of my learning journey, where I sought to create an engaging experience for the developer community. By using the Github API, I developed an application that generates dynamic cards, presenting relevant information about users' repositories.

Additionally, I created the layout for this project based on a web design challenge in Figma. [Link to all 'CodelÃ¢ndia' challenges](https://www.figma.com/file/Yb9IBH56g7T1hdIyZ3BMNO/Desafios---Codel%C3%A2ndia?type=design&node-id=624-2&mode=design&t=Trxmon2KQNwAqiIN-0 ).

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript:** A JavaScript superset language that adds optional static typing.
- **SCSS:** A stylesheet language that compiles to CSS.
- **Github API:** The official Github API for retrieving information about users and repositories.

## Functionalities

1. **User Research:**
    - Use the search field to find Github users.

2. **Dynamic Card Generation:**
    - When searching for a user, the application automatically generates cards with information about the repositories found.

3. **Repository Details:**
    - Each card displays details such as the repository name, description, predominant language and number of stars.

4. **Link to Github Repository:**
    - Easily access the repository on Github by clicking on the link provided on each card.
